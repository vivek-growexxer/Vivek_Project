# Churn Prediction and Customer Segmentation

This repository hosts the code and documentation for a project in the finance domain, specifically focusing on customer segmentation and churn prediction for a bank. We have utilized machine learning techniques to accurately identify customers at risk of churn and implemented advanced algorithms and predictive analytics to target high-risk customers and proactively mitigate churn. Through our efforts, we achieved an impressive reduction in losses up to 76%.

### Detailed Information

This project revolves around the following key components:

1. **Customer Segmentation**: We employed various segmentation techniques to group customers based on their behavior, demographics, and transactional patterns. This segmentation aids in understanding the diverse needs and preferences of different customer segments.

2. **Churn Prediction**: Predicting customer churn is crucial for retaining valuable customers. We utilized machine learning algorithms to predict which customers are likely to churn in the future. By identifying these customers early, the bank can take proactive measures to retain them.

3. **Machine Learning Techniques**: We implemented a range of machine learning techniques, including but not limited to decision trees, logistic regression, and ensemble methods like random forests and gradient boosting. These techniques were chosen for their effectiveness in handling the complexities of financial data and predicting customer behavior accurately.

4. **Predictive Analytics**: Leveraging predictive analytics, we generated insights into customer behavior and preferences. By analyzing historical data, we identified patterns that indicate potential churn risk factors. These insights were instrumental in designing targeted interventions to reduce churn.

5. **Impact Assessment**: The effectiveness of our approach was assessed through rigorous evaluation metrics. We measured the reduction in losses attributed to churn mitigation strategies implemented based on our predictions. The achieved reduction of up to 76% underscores the efficacy of our solution.
